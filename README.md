### Web Development

Web Dev is a really broad topic, but it can be a great way into software development for a lot of reasons:

* it touches on many parts of what makes computers useful to humans,
* there are so many pre-existing framewaorks and tools that it is fast to come up with useful sfotware and only touch on things that are unique to your task
* there is a high demand for people with even minimal skills
* much of the technology (html, css, JS) is highly fault-tolerant

With that said, there are a lot of routes to go here.  A minimal set of things to learn would be some kind of web framework that renders the data in a way that can be used by web browsers, as well as some ways of thinking about that development.  Ultimately, all you're doing is generating a document that is laoded by the browser... here's an [overview of the whole process](http://www.slashroot.in/httphypertext-transfer-protocol-request-and-response).

Fortunately, you probably don't even need to know many specifics to develop solutions for the web... a lot of frameworks will do things for you.  Here are some framework guides:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
* [Codecademy's introduction to Rails](http://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)
* [Django - a Python-based framework for the web](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Express: a Node-JS based framework](http://expressjs.com/)
* [Symfony: a PHP based framework](http://symfony.com/)
* [Wordpress isn't really a framework, though some folks use it as if it were](https://wordpress.org/)

## Misc Development
* [Bento.io - A guided tour through curated, free coding tutorials](http://bento.io)
* [Codecademy - Great way to quickly get up to speed in a new langauge](http://codecademy.com)
* [Learn to code the hard way - A collection of coding tutorials focusing on  repetition of fundamentals](http://learncodethehardway.org/)

## Computer Science
* [edX CS50 course - Intro to basic computer science and programming](tests/functional_tests/retailer/socal_data_tests.py)

## Testing
